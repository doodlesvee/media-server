# Runs a command with LAN_HOST set to this machine's address on the wifi.
#
# A container can only see its own address on the Docker bridge, so the
# Settings screen cannot find the address a phone should open by itself. The
# host can, so the npm scripts look it up here on every start — which also
# means a new address after changing networks is picked up by just starting
# again. An explicit LAN_HOST (in the shell or docker/.env) always wins.
#
# macOS names the wifi interface en0 on most machines and en1 on some; on
# Linux, `hostname -I` lists the addresses and the first is the LAN one.
