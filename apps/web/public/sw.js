/**
 * The service worker, kept deliberately small.
 *
 * Its only job is to make the app installable, so it opens in its own window
 * without browser chrome — which is what §33's "PWA" is worth on a desktop
 * media library. Chrome requires a fetch handler before it will offer to
 * install, so there has to be one.
 *
 * What it very deliberately does NOT do is cache anything from /api/. That
 * covers every media stream, thumbnail, preview and metadata response in the
 * app, and a cached copy is one that survives signing out and can be served
 * without the session cookie ever being checked — which is exactly what §29
 * forbids ("never expose media without authentication", "never expose
 * previews/thumbnails without authentication"). The Cache API is also not
 * cleared by the browser's own "clear site data" in every case, so artwork
 * put there could outlive a deliberate attempt to remove it.
 *
 * So: the built shell is precached, everything else goes to the network, and
 * an offline visit gets the shell rather than a dinosaur. An offline shell
 * with no library behind it is not much, but it is honest about why.
