     * macOS does not forward inotify events across a Docker bind mount, so
     * Vite's native watcher never fires and it goes on serving whatever it
     * compiled at startup — silently, with nothing logged. Every edit on the
     * host then appears to do nothing, which costs far more than the polling
     * does.
     *
     * Gated on the env var rather than always on, so running Vite directly on
     * the host keeps the cheap native watcher. The interval is a compromise:
     * low enough to feel immediate, high enough not to stat the tree
     * constantly. node_modules is a named volume rather than part of the bind
     * mount, so the polled set stays small.
