 * more than half have a single video — so it earns a row you scroll past, not
 * a permanent nav entry competing with Performers.
 *
 * Pinned first, then shuffled. It was ordered by size, on the reasoning that
 * the two studios holding most of the library are the only ones worth a click
 * from here — but that made the row the same two tiles every visit, and the
 * rest of the library unreachable from the home page. "See all" is where size
 * ordering still lives.
