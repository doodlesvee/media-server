 * Double-tap either side of the video to skip, the way every phone video
 * player does. Each further tap in quick succession skips again, so three
 * taps is twenty seconds.
 *
 * Only the outer thirds, and not the strip along the bottom where the seek
 * bar and the native control bar are. The middle is left to the browser, so
 * a tap there still does what a tap on a video natively does — shows its
 * controls — and nothing learned on other players stops working here.
 *
 * The zones run the full height and carry no z-index on purpose. On a phone
 * the video is barely 200px tall and the overlay buttons fill its top half,
 * so zones that avoided the buttons had almost no height left. Instead the
 * buttons, which come later in the DOM, simply paint over the zones and take
 * their own taps; every gap between them belongs to the gesture.
 *
 * Touch devices only, detected by the pointer rather than the screen width:
 * a narrow desktop window has a mouse, and a double-click there already
 * means fullscreen.
