 * A QR code, drawn as SVG from the module grid.
 *
 * Built as React elements rather than injecting the library's SVG string, so
 * nothing is ever set as raw HTML. One <path> for all the dark modules keeps
 * it to a single element however large the code is.
 *
 * Always dark on white, whatever the app's theme: phone cameras read inverted
 * codes unreliably, and the white margin (four modules, as the spec asks) is
 * what lets a scanner find the edges against a dark page.
