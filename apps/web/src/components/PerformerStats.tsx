/**
 * The shape of a performer's collection, as a strip under the banner.
 *
 * It began as one line of muted grey under the name, the same size and colour
 * as the bio below it, so it read as a caption and the figures were easy to
 * miss. Making it louder in place did not work — anything loud enough to
 * notice was competing with a 4xl name and a portrait for the same corner.
 * Room was the fix rather than weight, so it moved out here.
 *
 * The icon is what makes a figure findable without reading: you look for the
 * clock rather than parsing five numbers to see which one is a duration. It
 * sits in a tinted tile so the row has some structure to it and does not read
 * as a bare table.
 *
 * Every figure is derived from the same set the grid below renders, so the
 * numbers and the page can't disagree. Each is omitted when it would be noise
 * — no year range for a performer with no dated videos, no "unwatched" when
 * you have seen everything — rather than printing a row of zeroes.
