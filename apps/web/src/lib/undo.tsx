/**
 * Runs a reversible change and offers to put it back.
 *
 * The spec (§19) asks for non-blocking undo on the everyday edits — favourite,
 * tags, collections, watch state, metadata — rather than a confirm dialog in
 * front of each one. A dialog asks you to be sure before anything has
 * happened, which is the moment you know least; an undo lets the change land
 * and stays reachable for as long as the toast does.
 *
 * The toast layer already had the two pieces this needs: an `action` button
 * and a timer that pauses while the pointer is over the stack, so a toast
 * carrying an Undo you are reaching for cannot expire under the cursor. This
 * is only the pairing of a forward action with its inverse.
 *
 * Deliberately not a generic command stack. A stack implies undoing things in
 * order, long after the fact, and would have to reason about whether step 3
 * still makes sense once step 5 has touched the same item. One toast, one
 * inverse, live only while it is on screen — which is the window in which an
 * undo is actually a correction rather than a second edit.
