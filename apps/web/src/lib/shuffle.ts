 * during render: `Math.random()` in a render pass can hand back a different
 * answer each time React runs it, so a row of pictures could change while
 * you are looking at it. Given the same seed this always returns the same
 * index, and callers reshuffle by changing the seed — the time of the last
 * fetch works well, since it moves exactly when the data does.
 *
 * The mixing is a cheap integer hash. Without it, consecutive ids with the
 * same seed march through the list in step and a row picks frame 0 from the
 * first studio, frame 1 from the next, and so on — visibly a pattern rather
 * than a shuffle.
