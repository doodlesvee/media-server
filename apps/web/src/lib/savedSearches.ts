 * the canonical description of a view, and keeping a second representation
 * of one means two things to migrate every time a filter is added. Restoring
 * a saved search is then a navigation, not a state restore.
 *
 * Local rather than server-side, matching pinned items. These are a personal
 * shortcut on one machine, and the server has no notion of a saved view to
 * hang them off; if that changes, `read`/`write` are the only two functions
 * that would move.
