/**
 * The sort you last chose, remembered per surface.
 *
 * Sort was component state, so it reset to "Recently added" every time you
 * navigated away and back — choosing an order only held for as long as you
 * stayed on the page.
 *
 * Per surface rather than one global order, because the surfaces are asking
 * different questions. "Oldest release" is a reasonable way to read one
 * performer's back catalogue and a poor way to open a library you mostly want
 * the newest things from, and a single key would make choosing one silently
 * change the other.
 *
 * Browser storage rather than the server's appearance settings: this is a
 * navigation habit rather than a look, it changes far more often than
 * anything in that panel, and it is genuinely per-device — the order you want
 * on a laptop is not obviously the order you want on a phone.
