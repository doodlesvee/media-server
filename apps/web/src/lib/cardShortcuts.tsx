/**
 * The card the keyboard is pointing at, and what the single-key shortcuts do

 *
 * One listener for the whole app rather than one per surface. The first
 * version of this lived in MediaGrid, which meant the shortcuts worked on the
 * browse page and nowhere else — not on the home page, not on a performer's
 * rows, not in Related items. Since MediaCard is what every one of those
 * surfaces renders, having the *card* report engagement is what makes the
 * shortcuts a property of a card rather than of whichever container happened
 * to implement them.
 *
 * "Engaged" means hovered or focused, and it is the card's own business to
 * say so — see MediaCard. Focus wins over hover where both apply, so a
 * keyboard user walking a grid is never hijacked by wherever the pointer
 * happens to be resting.
