 * How far the image can travel in each axis, in on-screen pixels.

 *
 *  - **The cover fit.** `object-fit: cover` scales the source until it covers
 *    the frame, so exactly one axis overflows — whichever the source is
 *    "longer" in relative to the frame. That overflow is what
 *    `object-position` pans through. Crucially it's *inside* the element, so
 *    a later `scale(z)` magnifies it: one source pixel of pan shows up as z
 *    pixels of movement.
 *  - **The zoom.** Scaling a frame-sized box by z hides `(z - 1) x size` of
 *    it, panned by moving the transform origin. That figure is already in
 *    screen pixels, so it isn't multiplied again.
 *
 * At zoom 1 only one axis can move, which is why dragging sideways does
 * nothing until you zoom in on a normal landscape cover — there is genuinely
 * nothing hidden to the left or right.
