/**
 * The phrase someone has to type to confirm a restore.

 * word like "RESTORE": typing that proves only that you can read the dialog,
 * whereas the date is the one detail worth being sure about — restoring the
 * wrong archive destroys just as much as restoring none.
 *
 * Backup names are `media-server-<ISO with colons replaced by dashes>.tar.gz`.
