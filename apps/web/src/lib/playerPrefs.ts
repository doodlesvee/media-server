/**
 * Player preferences that follow you between videos.

 * The modal remounts its `<video>` when it swaps the muted preview for real
 * playback (`key={mode}`), which throws away everything set imperatively —
 * volume and playback rate included. So these live outside the element and
 * get re-applied whenever a new one loads.
 *
 * Every read and write is wrapped: `localStorage` doesn't just return null in
 * some privacy configurations, it throws on access, and an unguarded read
 * here would take the whole modal down.
