/**
 * Runs a library scan on an interval, so files dropped into a watched folder
 * appear without pressing Rescan.
 *
 * Deliberately a timer rather than a filesystem watcher. The media folders are
 * Docker bind mounts from macOS, and host-side writes raise no inotify events
 * inside the container — the same reason `tsx watch` never sees host edits to
 * the source mount. chokidar would hit the identical wall, and its polling
 * fallback stats every file on every tick, which costs the same as a scan
 * while adding a dependency and a second code path.
 *
 * Safe to repeat: the scanner reconciles rather than re-imports. Unchanged
 * files short-circuit on size and mtime, and the title/performer/studio syncs
 * each no-op once they already agree.
