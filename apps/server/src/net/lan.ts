 * Local-network exposure, decided from the address the client asked for.
 *
 * Not from the client's IP, which would be the obvious way and does not work
 * here: under Docker every request reaches the container through the bridge
 * gateway, so a browser on this machine and a phone on the wifi both arrive
 * as 172.18.0.1. There is nothing in the connection to tell them apart.
 *
 * What does differ is the address that was typed. This machine reaches the
 * app as localhost; anything else on the network has to name the host by its
 * LAN address, and that name travels in the Host header.
 *
 * So this is a convenience gate, not a security boundary: a Host header can
 * be forged by anyone who thinks to. It stops the app being *usable* from
 * other devices, which is what it is for. The password is what stops people
 * getting in, and that is unchanged either way.
