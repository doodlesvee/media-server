 * would otherwise discover at the only moment it matters.
 *
 * It never touches the live database. Everything is extracted to a temporary
 * directory and deleted afterwards, so verifying is safe to do at any time,
 * including while the app is being used.
 *
 * The SQL is parsed but not executed. Actually replaying a dump would need a
 * scratch database to replay it into, and creating one requires privileges
 * the app deliberately does not have; checking that the dump is complete and
 * syntactically whole is the strongest claim available without them, and it
