 * The condition every list of media has to satisfy.
 *
 * Two things hide an item: a folder that is no longer being scanned
 * (`inScope`), and a file that has gone from disk (`missingSince`). They were
 * applied separately, and inconsistently — performers and studios filtered
 * missing items out, the main library grid and search did not, so the same
 * video was absent from one page and present with a red badge on another.
 *
 * A missing item is not deleted. It still exists, still holds its tags and
 * performers, and is still counted by library health — it simply stops
 * appearing in the places you browse, because there is nothing behind it to
 * play. The one screen that deliberately shows them is the missing-videos
 * manager, which asks for them by name rather than going through here.
