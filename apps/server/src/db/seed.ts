 * The three categories the app ships with. Seeded rather than hardcoded so
 * they can be edited or removed later; only inserted when absent, so renaming
 * "Videos" doesn't get undone on the next boot.
 *
 * Seeding only ever runs on an empty table. `onConflictDoNothing` guards the
 * slug alone, which wasn't enough: creating a category named "Movies" picks
 * the slug `movies`, the seeded `movie` doesn't collide with it, and the next
 * boot re-added a second tile with the identical label. Once any category
 * exists the set is the user's to manage, and re-asserting defaults into it
 * can only fight them.
